# Volume Control using OpenCV | Python

## Overview

This project is a simple implementation of a hand gesture-based volume control system using Python and OpenCV. The program detects hand gestures from a webcam feed and adjusts the system volume accordingly. This project serves as a great introduction to computer vision and gesture recognition.

## Features

- **Real-time Hand Gesture Detection:** Uses OpenCV to detect hand gestures in real-time.
- **Volume Control:** Dynamically adjusts system volume based on the distance between fingers.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive control with natural hand movements.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Pycaw (for controlling system volume)

You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy pycaw
